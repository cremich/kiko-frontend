Welcome to the KIKO Frontend üëã This repository provides all frontend resources for the KIKO-App.

## üî¨ About KIKO

The name KIKO refers to the same named test project in the city of Cologne (Germany) based Kindergartens. Kiko (Kita Testung K√∂ln) is a SARS-CoV-2 testing program for kindergartens and was developed by the Institute of Virology at the University Hospital of Cologne, Germany.

KiKo is based on the "lollipop method" and pool PCR testing.

The lollipop method is a non-invasive method of sample collection. In this method, participants have to suck on a swab - like a lollipop - for 30 seconds. These swabs can then be used to perform a PCR test. The swabs are tested in a pool, which means that one PCR is performed per testing group with the swabs of all participants. If the test result of the pool PCR is negative, it means that SARS-CoV-2 could not be detected in any of tested participants. If the result is positive, all participants must be retested individually to identify the infected person. To prevent infected persons from infecting others, they must remain at home until they are no longer infectious.

The KIKO-App is a serverless software solution running on AWS. It aims to support institutions like Kindergarten or schools to implement the pool testing in their environments. The KIKO-App supports to document test results and forward positive test results to the participants or their representatives.
